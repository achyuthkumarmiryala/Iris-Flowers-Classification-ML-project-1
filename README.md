# 🌸 Iris Flowers Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. Utilizing the classic Iris dataset, the project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Dataset Source

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each described by four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Each sample is labeled with one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
